# REVERSED

## Description

We have friends tested positive for covid after going to University and cinema because the booking system did not block the seats around them.

We all want to go out during Covid period, but we are afraid of getting infected. Many people procrastinate a lot and not feeling motivated working at home with their bed just one feet away from their working table.

How can we make sure that we can work at an office space but keeping social distance at the same time to prevent ourselves from getting infected by coronavirus? We have the solution!
